XmlReader - Cursor based XML reader API

XmlReader is a XML reader library using a cursor based API based on
the equivalent API available in high level language frameworks like
.Net or Java.

XmlReader uses the GObject C library to provide object orientation
on top of the C programming language.

XmlReader aims at being a easy to use, predictable and low footprint
API for iterating and extracting data from a XML data stream coming
from files or memory buffers.

XmlReader is cursor based: the main object maintains an internal state
about the current position in the XML document object model loaded
by libxml-2.0; data is extracted from the XML data stream by advancing
the internal cursor and asking for the value of an XML node as referenced
by its name.
